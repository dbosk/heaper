We will have a make file with the building instructions.
We already have a file \enquote{Makefile}, for building this documentation, 
which we will extend by and include file \enquote{heapq.mk}.
Our starting point is thus:
\lstinputlisting{Makefile}

We can see that our include file is included above and that there is an 
instruction to build it from this source code.
We will give the contents of that file as the code block [[<<heapq.mk>>]] when 
we describe our code and the relations between the different files we will use 
herein.
However, we will use C++, so we can set some of the variables:
<<heapq.mk>>=
CFLAGS+=		-Wall -Wextra
CXXFLAGS+=	-Wall -Wextra --std=c++11
